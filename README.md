# mkdocs_material-Codespace-Docker

This is a working project to get Docker working in a GitHub Codespace with Tailscale. This is a work in progress :)

There are two files and trails what we need to work on 
1) Vscode settings (1_Vscode_addons.md) and 
2) Docker settings (2_devcontainers.md).

Goal is to have a learning platform for students to do first year courses in a GitHub Codespace.
